## üêõ Reporting Issues

Found a bug or unexpected behavior? Please open an issue with:

- Your Rust version and operating system
- Whether you're using sync or async APIs (or both)

## üß™ Improvements

Contributions that improve the crate are very welcome:

- **New helper functions**
  - Small, clearly useful additions (e.g., a missing mirror of an existing function, or a lightweight convenience wrapper) ‚Üí feel free to open a PR directly.
  - Larger or more opinionated additions ‚Üí please open an issue first so we can discuss design and naming. This helps keep the API consistent.
- **Additional tests**: Help us catch edge cases and improve reliability
- **Performance improvements**: Optimizations to existing functions
- **Documentation improvements**: Better examples, clearer explanations
- **Error handling**: More informative error messages or better error types

### Before Opening an Issue

**Check existing functionality**: Browse the [API documentation](docs/api-reference.md) to see if something similar exists already.

### When Opening a Feature Request

Please include:

- **Use case**: What problem does this solve? Real-world examples help!
- **Proposed API**: What would the function signature look like?
